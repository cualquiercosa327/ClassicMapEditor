# Classic Controller Button Mapping Code Editor

There are a few Wii games with codes that you can apply (using something like
Gecko or MinimaLauncher) to add Classic Controller support. So far I've found
codes for:

* New Super Mario Bros. Wii
* Donkey Kong Country Returns
* Kirby's Return to Dream Land

(See: https://gbatemp.net/threads/which-games-have-classic-controller-hacks.321713/#post-4716016)

This app lets you edit the button mappings in these codes. Just paste the code
into the text area on the right (or import a GCT from the File menu.) The left
column will show Classic Controller mappings; the right column shows which Wii
Remote buttons they're mapped to.

Some of these codes include a button mapped to "shake"; you can change the
Classic Controller button, but the right column will just show the part of the
code responsible for the shake effect (which varies by game.)

Special thanks to crediar, who made most of these codes in the first place.
